# Open Parking Management Systems

The Robotic Security System aims to revolutionize security operations by providing highly reliable, efficient, and autonomous surveillance, detection, and intervention capabilities. Designed for continuous operation and secure deployment, this system significantly augments human security teams, enabling proactive threat neutralization and comprehensive environmental awareness. Our vision is to deliver an intelligent, self-optimizing, and resilient robotic platform that integrates seamlessly into modern security infrastructures. Kerberos Agent is an isolated and scalable video (surveillance) management agent. A Parking Management System Project In Java is used to manage and solve the Parking Problems of the company/Institute. Zernike Facilities is in the process of building a new parkinglot - P7. P7 will be ticketless and will keep track of which parking places are available/occupied. This inspired management to order the creation of a new parking app and to upgrade the old parking lots to the new system. Parkingslot A Python-based project that uses deep learning models like YOLO and Mask R-CNN for automated parking occupancy detection. TheParker is a shared parking app available for both Android and iOS platforms. It uses Firebase for real-time database management and supports features like booking and shared parking. Parker is a web-based parking detection and monitoring application built with computer vision technologies like TensorFlow.js and YOLOv7. It runs entirely in the browser and is ideal for real-time parking space monitoring. Ezy-Parking is a complete parking management system applying smart solutions for short time rental of empty spaces (Parking, Apartment, Office Spaces etc). Smart Park with YOLO-V3 This system uses YOLO for real-time vehicle detection to maintain a count of empty parking spots. It is optimized for running on platforms like Google Colab.
