# Open Parking Management Systems

A Parking Management System Project In Java is used to manage and solve the Parking Problems of the company/Institute. Parkingslot A Python-based project that uses deep learning models like YOLO and Mask R-CNN for automated parking occupancy detection. Open Quadruped is an open-source 3D-printed quadrupedal robot. Intuitive gait generation through 12-DOF Bezier Curves. Full 6-axis body pose manipulation. Custom 3DOF Leg Inverse Kinematics Model accounting for offsets. Parker is a web-based parking detection and monitoring application built with computer vision technologies like TensorFlow.js and YOLOv7. It runs entirely in the browser and is ideal for real-time parking space monitoring. Ezy-Parking is a complete parking management system applying smart solutions for short time rental of empty spaces (Parking, Apartment, Office Spaces etc). Smart Park with YOLO-V3 This system uses YOLO for real-time vehicle detection to maintain a count of empty parking spots. It is optimized for running on platforms like Google Colab.
